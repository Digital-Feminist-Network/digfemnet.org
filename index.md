The Digital Feminist Network is a group of feminist and queer scholars dedicated to iteratively designing and co-facilitating toolkits that counter online hate. Our commitment is to mobilize our range of expertise to build and share resources with other academics, local university groups, students, and public communities in order to identify various forms of [technology-facilitated gender-based violence](https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/faqs/tech-facilitated-gender-based-violence#:~:text=Technology%2Dfacilitated%20gender%2Dbased%20violence,or%20economic%20harm%20or%20other) (TFGBV) and understand how they operate online. Ultimately, our aim is to counter forms of TFGBV through evidence- and experience-based resources and coalitions of feminist solidarity.

Over the last decade, the uptake in media attention around feminism has been matched by an increase in TFGBV. Such violence has been directed at women, girls, and non-people across digital and physical spaces, with social media and other digital platforms playing a crucial role in furthering TFGBV hate campaigns.

As committed feminist scholars, we focus on the connection between online hate, everyday forms of harassment, and the increasing physical violence in our living, working, and educational spaces. This violence, fuelled by targeted disinformation spread via social media platforms, is not only an urgent public safety issue for Canada but a fundamental human rights issue that threatens teaching, learning, and, more broadly, democracy and social cohesion, and requires concentrated and immediate attention.
