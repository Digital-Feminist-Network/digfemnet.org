### DH Toolbox Series

* "**New languages for old languages: digital tools and methods for ancient history**" - Lydia Schriemer
  * Did women have legal and financial independence in Rome? Did Christianity make a difference? Did people actually follow the ‘Law’? Lyrdia Schriemer (Religious Studies) will join us to discuss some of the digital tools used in her research on the contractual abilities of women in Greek-language contracts from the Later Roman Empire and their role in studying the ancient world more broadly.

* « **Qu’est ce que le mot féminisme veut dire?** » - Pascale Dangoisse Matecki
  * Dans la presse traditionnelle, le féminisme est souvent réduit à des questions qui font les gros titres, comme le droit à l’avortement et à des services de garde abordables – importantes, certes, mais qui ne sont que la partie émergée de l’iceberg. En revanche, des plateformes non traditionnelles comme les blogs révèlent le pouls plus profond du féminisme : un appel à l’autonomie corporelle, à une éducation équitable, à l’accès aux soins de santé et à des politiques transnationales. Ces voix de la base nous rappellent que le féminisme n’est pas une liste de contrôle ; c’est un mouvement pour un changement systémique, qui va de l’autonomisation personnelle à la refonte de la politique étrangère. Là où la presse simplifie, les femmes amplifient. Dans cette session Pascale Dangoisse Matecki (Communication et Cultures numériques) partagera les résultats de ses recherches doctorales sur les politiques féministes en contexte politique libéral.

* "**Intersectional classification, in theory**" - Kayla Dold
  * This presentation explores what intersectional classification systems and practices might look like. Building on library and information science, digital humanities, and critical theory literature, we will explore what underlying assumptions and approaches to data-driven projects best support intersectionality. Kayla Dold (Digital Transformation and Innovation) will lead us through a conversation about how to balance the material and discursive usefulness of classifications with their normative power, highlight the lived experience of classification, and compare single facets of multi-faceted identities. The purpose of this work is to suggest how we can conduct transformative research on, and with, classification systems in ways that respect intersectionality as a social theory.
